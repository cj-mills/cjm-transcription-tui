"""Sidecar TUI state: last-used run settings persisted across sessions (the
correction-TUI state pattern). Root demand (drive 1, 2026-07-15): the first
full run went UNJOURNALED because --graph-capability was forgotten — settings
the operator picked once (journal target, sysmon, candidate picks, last
directory) must never need retyping. The file lives NEXT TO the manifests dir
(one level up — .cjm/ in practice) so state is per-project, not per-user.
